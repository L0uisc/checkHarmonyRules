checkHarmonyRules
=================

A plugin for MuseScore v2 to check rules for writing harmony.

This plugin aimes at providing the functionality of the harmonyRules plugin
by Yvonne Cliff for MuseScore v1, which doesn't work with v2.

This is not a port of the original plugin, but completely rewritten.
Both plugins might therefore generate slightly different results.

If you discover greater discrepancies or problems, please let me know.

Warning: Please safe your score before using this plugin.
